  Question:"What is functional programming?", 
  Answer:"A very simple definition of functional programming is this: writing a program only in pure functions. Pure functions never modify variables, but only create new ones as an output. Functional programming is all about building functions for immutable variables. https://towardsdatascience.com/why-developers-are-falling-in-love-with-functional-programming-13514df4048e"

  Question:"Can you enumerate all JavaScript data types?",
  Answer:"To enumerate is defined as to mention things one by one or to make clear the number of things. An example of enumerate is when you list all of an author's works one by one.There are 6 Javascript data types and I think they can all be enumerated (String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined and Object). I think they can be https://www.folkstalk.com/tech/enumerate-node-js-with-code-examples/"

  Question:"What is a callback function in JavaScript and when would you use one?",
  Answer:"A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, to be “called back” when needed at a later time. The callback function is helpful when you have to wait for a result that takes time. For example if you need to wait for data coming from a server which takes time to arrive."

{
  Question:"How would you explain an API request?",
  Answer:"An API request occurs when a developer adds an endpoint to a URL and makes a call to the server. It can be GET (gets the data), POST (adds new data), PUT (edits the data) and Delete (deletes the data)"

{
  Question:"What is the difference between == & === in JS?",
  Answer:"=== compares data types and values so “6” and 6 would not be equal. == just compares the values. === is strict equality."

  Answer:"Let vs Var, Arrow functions, Multi line with back-ticks, Removed semi-colons, Use of switches is becoming deprecated, Template Literals, Destructuring Assignment, Promises, Classes, Modules https://www.boardinfinity.com/blog/top-10-features-of-es6/"
},
{
  Question:"What are the advantages of one-way binding (e.g React or Vue)?",
  Answer:"One-way data-binding means the data flows in a single direction so that whenever the data changes in a component, it also updates the view with new data. The advantage of one-way binding is that it can bring about one-way data flow. The advantage of this is that all state changes can be recorded and tracked, and state changes are manually invoked Notice, the source is easy to trace, there is no 'black box operation'. At the same time, component data has only a single entry and exit, making the program more intuitive and easier to understand, which is beneficial to the maintainability of the application https://blog.actorsfit.com/a?ID=01450-2f7aef83-82f7-4407-883e-3af8e3f92c40"
},
{
  Question:"What are the differences between functional programming & object-oriented programming?",
  Answer:"Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has been around for longer and is more popular, but Functional Programming (FP) is starting to catch up. The apparent difference is that OOP uses objects and methods as the key coding elements, while FP emphasizes functional factors such as variables and functions https://webo.digital/blog/object-oriented-vs-functional-programming/"
},
{
  Question:"What’s the difference between let, var and const?",
  Answer:"Let and var are the same, but var is deprecated. Const is a constant so its value cannot be reassigned. "
},
{
  Question:"What is destructuring?",
  Answer:"The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables."

{
  Question:"What is Flexbox? How have you used it?",
  Answer:"CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as Flexbox, is a CSS 3 web layout model. The flex layout allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending on viewport size"
},
{
  Question:"What is TDD? What’s the benefits of using it?",
  Answer:"Test Driven Development. Write a single test, fail it and then write as little code as possible to make the test pass. Refactor the code and then repeat with a new test. The advantage is that Benefits are supposed to be that there is a significant reduction in defect rates, but downsides are teams sometimes forget to run frequent tests, writing too many tests in one go or writing trivial tests."
},
{
  Question:"What is BDD?",
  Answer:"Behaviour Driven Development.Essentially, day-to-day BDD activity is a three-step, iterative process: First, take a small upcoming change to the system – a User Story – and talk about concrete examples of the new functionality to explore, discover and agree on the details of what’s expected to be done. Next, document those examples in a way that can be automated, and check for agreement. Finally, implement the behaviour described by each documented example, starting with an automated test to guide the development of the code. The idea is to make each change small and iterate rapidly, moving back up a level each time you need more information. Each time you automate and implement a new example, you’ve added something valuable to your system, and you’re ready to respond to feedback. These practices are known as Discovery, Formulation, and Automation."
},
{
  Question:"What’s the difference between TDD & BDD?",
  Answer:"TDD is written in code, BDD is written in natural language. TDD is implemented by developers, BDD is developed by all team members. TDD - the developers responsibility to develop and maintain, BDD - everyone’s responsibility. TDD - White Box Testing, BDD - Black Box Testing"

{
  Question:"What is the BEM CSS methodology?",
  Answer:"BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier. It’s a CSS naming convention for writing cleaner and more readable CSS classes. BEM also aims to write independent CSS blocks in order to reuse them later in your project."
},
{
  Question:"What is a function?",
  Answer:"A function is simply a “chunk” of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times."
},
{
  Question:"What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?",
  Answer:"SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON"
},
{
  Question: "What is the difference between a Method and a Function",
  Answer: "A method is a procedure or function in OOPs Concepts. Whereas, a function is a group of reusable code which can be used anywhere in the program"
